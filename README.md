# Logical Puzzle Generator

Logical Puzzle Generator creates small, printable Einstein-style ordering puzzles and verifies them mathematically before returning them. Version 1.0 focuses on a stable 4-item puzzle pipeline: generate a solution, derive constraints, convert them to clues, validate uniqueness, reduce redundant clues, and render child-friendly A4 puzzle and solution PDFs.

## Version 1.0 capabilities

- Generate a complete one-to-one assignment of puzzle items to positions.
- Derive internal mathematical constraints from the generated solution.
- Convert supported constraints into human-readable English clues and render localized clue text for PDFs.
- Validate that a puzzle has exactly one solution using the brute-force solver.
- Reduce unnecessary clues while preserving unique solvability and at least one clue.
- Generate printable A4 puzzle and solution PDFs with ReportLab in English (`en`, default) or German (`de`).
- Render the Tennis puzzle as a horizontal child-friendly lineup of four anonymous vector girls, empty handwriting boxes, and left-to-right position numbers.
- Provide a Tennis theme and a convenience entry point that writes PDFs to `output/`.

Version 1.0 is intentionally limited to ordering puzzles over one active category of items. Additional category relationships, richer clue types, JSON export, batch generation, GUI/web interfaces, and larger puzzle sizes are Version 2+ work.

## Installation

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pip install -e .
```

The package requires Python 3.11 or newer.

## Run tests and checks

```bash
pytest
ruff check src tests
black --check src tests
mypy src
```

## Generate a puzzle and PDFs

Use the built-in entry point to generate the Tennis puzzle PDFs:

```bash
python -m logical_puzzle_generator.create_puzzle
python -m logical_puzzle_generator.create_puzzle --number 3 --language en
python -m logical_puzzle_generator.create_puzzle --number 3 --language de
```

By default this writes:

- `output/puzzle_3.pdf`
- `output/puzzle_3_solution.pdf`

You can also call the public API directly:

```python
from logical_puzzle_generator.create_puzzle import create_puzzle

puzzle = create_puzzle(
    number=3,
    puzzle_path="output/puzzle.pdf",
    solution_path="output/solution.pdf",
    language="de",
)
print(puzzle.metadata.title)
```

To generate a puzzle without writing PDFs:

```python
from logical_puzzle_generator.generator import PuzzleGenerator
from logical_puzzle_generator.themes.tennis import create_template

puzzle = PuzzleGenerator().generate(create_template())
print([clue.text for clue in puzzle.clues])
```

The puzzle PDF uses A4 portrait output. Its Tennis layout shows four anonymous vector girls from left to right, one empty writable name box per position, position numbers 1-4, localized clues, and a separate available-names list. The solution PDF reuses the same lineup and fills the boxes from `puzzle.solution.assignment` without solving again.

To render PDFs for an existing puzzle:

```python
from logical_puzzle_generator.pdf.generator import PdfGenerator

pdf = PdfGenerator(language="en")
pdf.create_puzzle_pdf(puzzle, "output/puzzle.pdf")
pdf.create_solution_pdf(puzzle, "output/solution.pdf")
```

## Language support

English is the default for backward compatibility. German can be selected with `--language de`, `create_puzzle(..., language="de")`, or `PdfGenerator(language="de")`. Public callers may also use `Language.GERMAN`. Unsupported language values are rejected instead of silently falling back. Localization is presentation-only: solver, validator, constraints, and generation semantics remain language-independent. Difficulty is estimated from the final visible constraints after clue reduction and stored as numeric metadata internally, while puzzle and solution PDFs render localized child-friendly labels (`Easy`/`Medium`/`Hard` or `Leicht`/`Mittel`/`Schwierig`) instead of raw numbers.

### Difficulty estimation

Generated puzzles now calculate numeric difficulty from the final visible constraints after clue reduction. Fixed-position constraints are anchors, direct-left/direct-right constraints are strong relative clues, adjacency is ambiguous, and left/right relations are weak relative clues. The heuristic is deterministic and child-oriented; PDF localization only maps `1/2/3` to `Easy/Medium/Hard` or `Leicht/Mittel/Schwierig`.
